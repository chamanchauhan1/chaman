  - Tag numbers and identification
  - Species (cattle, sheep, goat, pig, poultry)
  - Breed, date of birth, and weight
  - Status tracking (active, quarantine, sold, deceased)

### Treatment Record Management
- Record detailed treatment information:
  - Medicine name and antimicrobial type
  - Dosage, unit, and administration details
  - Withdrawal periods and end dates

3. Update the storage configuration in `server/storage.ts`

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Express backend server
- Vite development server for the frontend
- The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`

#### Production Build

Build the application for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

Run the production build:
```bash
npm start
```

### Running in VS Code

#### Option 1: Using VS Code Terminal

1. **Open the project in VS Code**:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

2. **Open the integrated terminal** (Terminal → New Terminal or `` Ctrl+` ``)

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open the application**:
   - The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`
   - Open this URL in your browser

#### Option 2: Using VS Code Launch Configuration

Create a `.vscode/launch.json` file with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch Program",
      "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs",
      "args": ["server/index.ts"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "development"
      },
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then press `F5` or go to Run → Start Debugging.

#### Recommended VS Code Extensions

Install these extensions for the best development experience:

- **ESLint** (dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- **Prettier** (esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Code formatting
- **TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features** (built-in) - IntelliSense
- **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** (bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) - Tailwind CSS autocompletion
- **Path Intellisense** (christian-kohler.path-intellisense) - File path autocomplete
- **PostCSS Language Support** (csstools.postcss) - PostCSS syntax support

#### VS Code Settings

Create a `.vscode/settings.json` file for consistent formatting:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  },
  "typescript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier": "non-relative"
}
```

### User Roles

The application supports two user roles:

1. **Farmer**: Can manage their own farms, animals, and treatment records
2. **Inspector**: Can view and monitor compliance across multiple farms

- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Add proper error handling and user feedback

## Testing

The application includes `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements for testing purposes.
